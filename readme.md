https://www.figma.com/design/hw5hfbrYc2SDWhcBjZeVqV/Responsive-Landing-Page-Design-%7C-Website-Home-Page-Design-%7C-Agency-Website-UI-Design--Community-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=cGtDkgo8FHt4Z8E6-0

____________________________
The following structure will be observed in the development of this work:

index.html
styles.css
readme.md
images

The requirements are as follows:
_____________________________
1. HTML STRUCTURE

• Create an index.html file with a semantic structure using tags such as <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>.

• Include sections equivalent to those in the proposed design: hero, features, workflow, partners, call-to-action, and footer.

_____________________________
2. CSS STYLES

• Use an external styles.css file to apply all styles.

• Incorporate fonts from Google Fonts (according to the design).

• Use a color palette, spacing, and visual hierarchy consistent with the original design.

• Apply visual effects such as hover effects to buttons, links, and cards.

_____________________________
3. RESPONSIVE DESIGN

• Implement responsive design using Flexbox and/or CSS Grid.

Ensure the site displays correctly on:

Desktop (≥ 1024px), Tablet (≥ 768px), Mobile (≤ 480px)

______________________________
DEVELOPMENT

During the process, the use of different tags and functions required to complete the code can be observed. Comments specify or mention the task performed in each part or section of the HTML and CSS code. In both code snippets, the reason for use is specified, and brief descriptions are provided in case the code is unclear.

The images, buttons, and functions used allow for the visualization of the code. When the full viewer is opened, the transition and change from code to image is observed, just as it appears in Figma.

In the CSS, some specific data is used to give the design a clean and professional look. Responsive design and some tags like Grid and Google Fonts are used to refine and model the code in an optimal and clear way.
